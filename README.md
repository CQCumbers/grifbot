Grifbot uses a 2-layer, character-level LSTM trained on Red vs. Blue transcripts (from roostertooths.com) to create similar text. The bot seeds this model with a facebook messenger message and replies with the dialogue the model generates. Due to limited training data and compute, among numerous other issues, output quality is far below the state of the art, though hopefully entertaining nevertheless.

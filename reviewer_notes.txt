Grifbot responds to user messages in a way similar to how Grif, a fictional character from the popular show Red vs Blue (RvB), would. In the show, Grif is a private in the space marines who is known for saying many random and nonsensical but occasionally humourous things, as well as not following commands. Grifbot, therefore, intentionally provides irrelevant information and does not follow commands - this is expected by its target audience of RvB fans. It uses a neural network trained on scripts to generate its responses, so they are unpredictable. No responses are hardcoded and it is intended merely to provide an entertaining conversation (to fans of the show), not to carry out any particular task.

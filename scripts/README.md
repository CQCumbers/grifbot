# RvB Script Generator

If you're interested in generating your own scripts, the easiest method is probably to use the [colaboratory notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1E00PIyVoXxrWc18A9Zjg03L8yYXuAfQm). This will allow you to run the script generation code for free on Google's GPU servers. However, the notebook does not include a pre-trained RvB model, so you'll need to download `model_config.json`, `model_vocab.json`, and `model_weights.hdf5` from this folder, and upload them through the notebook's *Files* window. You can then generate text by selecting *Runtime* -> *Run All*.

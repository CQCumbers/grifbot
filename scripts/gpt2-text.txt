Blood Gulch Chronicles Season 17
Episode 1:  Festival of the Disappeared

Fade in to Sawmill Square outside the Warthog
Sarge:(on the radio). He's asking demuos for directions to the morgue
Willow:Till after the war...
Sarge:By May?
Cut to Tucker with a shotgun on the Warthog waiting for his fix
Tucker:Grr, you guys seem to be really hard on yourself lately. How's Saturday's shooting?
Church:(still looking at Donut) How were we?
Sarge:We held an extra assignment that we didn't wanna miss. And I knew the costs were prohibitive.
Caboose looks up at Tucker
Tex:Caboose, Where will we be?
Caboose:Helluella!
Tucker:Well that's why I sent you for the interrogator. In frisbee. Oh yes. Hah:I wanna get near the birds. They're watching us! I just need your favourite music. Puking. No, it's... puking. Okay, um, cue the radio.
Tucker:Alright, take those problems with Country music. And also uh, uh, girls.
Tex runs straight at Tucker and hits him in the head
Tucker:Gotcha.
Church on the Blues Oh God. That's awesome.
Cut to Space
Church:Hey kid, if you come along that way by yourself, I'll kill you on sight.
Grif:Hey? Is that what you were saying?
Church:I said see? That's what I was saying.
Grif:Yeah, help me read this. You won't believe this. I didn't think I'd be able to see it.
Church:Right.
Grif:Listen, he can't see it, he can't see the picture. He's fixed.
Tucker:Church? Aren't we all fixing God now?
Church:Hey ...Well, other fixes.
Tucker:Church, are you about to get pregnant or whatever?
Church:No. I just can't really find your tranquilizer problem to come from.
Tucker:Oh too bad.
Church:Okay, don't tell anyone this, but Doc already put me in the tank.
Tucker:What?
Church:And he's gonna want to have surgery on you at some point.
Sarge:Anyway he'll have to work for at least two more weeks but that's okay. Don't you have any money?
Tucker:Why would I want one at all?
Church:Yeah, well then you know if you flash, then you'd probably do the reload.
Tucker:You're correct.
Church:Wait a second wait a second wait...
Tucker:Ooh, don't do that again.
Church:I heard you could just have us do it.
Tucker:Alright, well I had lots of fun and now I can't even do that. ...When do you guys take it from us?
Church:Naw, I don't know, maybe six to eight weeks from now I'm gonna get a tattoo or something. And you'll be their last prisoner, right?
Tucker:Exactly. I'm sure that day when they decided that or whatever they wanted to do with us in year four with no food, nobody would step in to hold us hostage.
Church:I know. Unexpected? But asking somebody else a favor. ...I still don't get it. Mother's Day is just over and done. Tell 'em it's about to come up.
Caboose:There's never been one death so informally short.
Church:No way, it never happened. You know, extirpating yourself from the reality of your own little survival was really the best way to make it as simple an experience as possible for yourself. Tu-tu-tin da wonderland we thought. U waaaahse.
Sister:I love you, sis. Seriously, you're amazed everyone would let me solo. It almost seemed like a heavy duty operation! They are truly friggin awesome! I'll be sure to update them when ever I have access to their old teleport logs.
Tucker:Uh, just a thought. Simmons? If you got your ass kicked, we'll have some spare parts. Oh, come on...
Cut to Caboose hiding behind a rock in the base, short hair, thinking Caboose would use some of his favorite armor to hide his face.
Caboose:I have not seen it
Tucker:Aw man, that's awesome. I love it.
Cut to Inigo, Sheila, Crocea Mecumne and Tucker talking in the isle
Inigo:Uh, what now? (turns to the left)
Caboose:Okay, this place is what should have taught us everything we know about our galaxy. So, it's called Order 5, Blue Kills, Blood Gulch Preppers, Blood Gulch Saves and Blood Gulch Survives.
Inigo:Okay, as you all know, this is the ultimate pain training ground, in no small part, to help you properly train quads. In other words: you can fucking die. And that's got to get me in top shape.
Caboose:That sounds like a negotiation!
Tucker:Okay, I only saw a crappy candidate. Oh well.
Back in the red bases... back in the gun room
Everyone except Caboose and Jack sneaking back and forth through the opening in the back
Caboose:Hey. Those aren't up there, they're in the bowels. Oh wait. Why didn't you say something about what context I need to stress?
Wyoming:Well I get to argue with them, you which one of you next?
Tucker:Uhh, or... wait... Uhh- Sorry, wait-
Winters down the hallway
Tucker:Uhhhh.
Simmons:Hey Tucker, just talking.
Tucker:Uh, yeah, great, just use what's on your mind.
Simmons:Yeah?
Cut to Caboose in the Warthog
Caboose:What're you doing all this socializing, look at that, stuffy little Doc.
Tucker:It's nifty, you know.
Caboose:Don't talk to me about it, 'cause that would call you a pervert. ...You know what else I can do, 'cause Dabo sucked my blood.
Tucker:I guess you own the Warthog.
Caboose:No I'm not helpin' him.
Tucker:Ooohhhhhha!
Back to the red base
Tucker:Ooh. ... ... ... What the hell is wrong with them?
Back to the red base, Sheila holstering Sheila's Warthog
Sheila:Shut up, Sarge, she's an ass, you really should get rid of her immediately.
Sarge:Sheila, he's eye-mouthy. Forget what she told you about sniper guns.
Caboose:I know. Caboose never said that about him, unless you ask her if she likes him. Sheila, wait... what is she saying? A sniper gun sucks.
Sarge:You unhissed it. Now move forward.
Simmons:Sarge, I don't see a target Artoo. We'll be sure to go after that red one, so he can't attack us. We'll deal with him on our own.
Sarge and the Blues look at each other
Grif:Monutracker.
Church:Wait, I'm not scared, I'm got to get away from this thing.
Sarge:Sheila? Are you crying? I heard, your screams aren't coming out at frame.
Camera pans up to reveal Simmons in front of Gulch
Simmons:Hi, I'm here to talk to Tucker. I need you to list each mission that you've been through, and then exit.
I need you to list each mission that you've been through,... la la la
Simmons:Oh no!!
Red Queen:Let's go Red Queen. Somebody help me switch stuff.
Simmons:Talk.
Red Queen:I wanna talk, the subject... uh, finally he heard me, I think he went to a secret base over there, and he found a military body, and told the whole army if yer skunk gets to be behind yer turret, he's gonna get up in here and shoot yer bullets straight at me.
Sarge:...that.
Simmons:Exactly.
Sarge:Can you hear the rustle? Yeeeek, yezamn, I don't think so. How are the jeeps now? They blew it up, and they don't even know what it is, yor pop outta my skylight. I'm scared, I musta go heal.
Caboose:(shooting at the Blues as they run away on the tank) 3rd plan! Ruhraid! Run!
Tucker:Hey Church. Fifth plan! Uhh, take the tank, stop the damsel, talk to me. Name me Dicky Tex. Eat your heart out, Tom-
Sarge:-oay!
O'Malley glances at Sarge and sees the tank that's noticed him
O'Malley:-hey, Doc!
Doc:(looking in the tank) Hey, you're stealing. (clears throat) Yeah I don't think so. Get behind the runnin' rock!
Simmons:Wait! We've got red base!
Grif:That? If we're gonna go on this fool's tour, we're gonna have to head down to Blue Base.
Grif'S Sister:I don't see the point of taking a platoon lunatic and leaving Doc alone with Lopez. If Doc does shoot Lopez'... you don't kill Lopez.
Church:Ow right! First turn ev'ry little dirtbag, we'll have to head back to base.
Doc:Let's just say I met with a lot more respect than some crapies in tossing rocks.
Church:Slow you ugly dust can you!? Hey Doc ya' the twit whore! What tha hell was that guy like?
Doc:What?
Church:Oh, he was just a nice little guy disc jockeying up there. I didn't dirtbag-
Doc runs up to get rid of him
Doc:Hey, Church, I'm not like that. I was just 'round talking with 'em. And now I'm stuck trying to find their flag. I need a roof over my head.
Church:Cutie-Makin'-
The Red Zealot
Warthog:Roger that. I'm guessing "Roger that" is a code phrase from Radiohead's previous song "Hellboy"
Church looks at the red
Church:What the hell are those guys famous for? Yeah, rips off each one of their heads.
Warthog puts the reds in her sniper rifle
Phyllis:What in the name of science d'oh?
X-Man bullets his way through Church until he blows up the Spirit
Church:Oh my God I need a new person! Armor always been my enemy! Armor is good armor! That's all you guys are supposed to wear!
The Soldier:Help!
Grif:I can't think of anything else.
Church:You know I've never been here. Couldn't... don't tell anyone!
Church shoots his way through a back wall
Church:Huh? I turn around, you didn't turn around! You turned around, messed up your front!
Simmons:I'm going to this Church meeting to get an order from them.
Grif:We have to go! We have to take out our enemies!
Simmons:What if the forces behind them are storming in to the neutral point too quickly? What if this is the Alien invasion or something?
Sarge:Shut up Caboose you idiot. What the hell were you guys talking about?
Caboose:Alright, now that we head down to the Blue base, change your tune, sis sonofabitch.
Simmons:We're a team of unknown but good. All of it's down. Tomorrow, we're hoping to get our hands on some useful blue technology.
Cut back to the red army fading in on the Tex log, then back to the reds
Simmons:Alright, yourself or me. I think I've found our next target.
Grif runs out of ammo
Grif:OK, I guess I just gotta get 'em all! Let's go open that weird portal then.
Tucker runs up to the teleporter, but Grif is distracted by really really really powerful teleports
Tucker:(turning around, sorry) Tucker!
Fade in to the battle for Defiance's Defiance's skull
Church and Simmons:Hey Chet Guys! Let's face it, conquering real estate must be fun.
Tucker:Yeah right. I'd go push out to Church creek ahead, if anything blows up in...
Cut back to Church
Tucker:Leon?
Church:Credits turkey, orders cleared, gib.
Tucker:You got me!
Fade to Donut
Donut:Alright he's got me, and that I'm the saviour of our land.
Caboose:Oh let's hold off against some fool probably already knows who you are right now. Did you see Tex through the spider salve?
Donut:Uh huh.
Caboose:Whoa!
Church:Oh. Right. Say something Tex. The situation sucks. Let's get in position. We need cover in the canyon.
Church:Tex, what's goin' on out here? Tex, what is goin' on? Huh? Whrrrggggh. Huh? I don't see anything!
Caboose:Ahhh... Let me out then... (runs off) Sorry Tex.
Tucker:I got a head start here. ...I'll keep that straight.
Cut to Caboose getting ready to leave
Caboose:Now. From our side we'll stick with Lopez.
Church:So you're not gonna come up with any great ideas for Tuesday?
Caboose:I don't know what to say, bi.
Church:I learn something great every day. But I'm not sure I get it every time, and I learned it every time with a surprising degree of luck. Yeah I'm serious.
Caboose:Alright, let's go.
Tucker:Agreed.
Church:This way.
Tucker:I'm not sure how to make it.
Church A:We can do whatever we want.
Tucker:I can't see any help.
Church:Tucker, those two are straight-up horrible. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait wait, look, look at those babies. I can't see; do you're hurting me?
Tucker:Uhm, then try to make me sit up.
Church:*cough*
Tucker:No waiting a second, I'll sure listen to ya.
Church:Okay, do it.
Camera angle misses one of the babies in front of them as the assassination is complete
Mannequin:Ahhhhhhh Manaring Descent, Alien Stalker, Omega, 70's-era, record breaking ranking! We're today's Blue Team: Easy, easy, no waiting.
Alien:Noh oh Queen of the Hill! York, York is here! Roos York!
York:(catching follow-up shot that pans around the big blue obelisk) Uh, there, there.
Church:Yeh, yes there is York. I'm Blue! Come in York.
York:Ahh yes, wha- chemical language checker, hi York! I hear something-
Church:Descent done, try this again York. York ability score of 1.00, dammit, what're you doin' here?
York:(under breath sounds) Will be finally outta action unconsciousness.
York:Hey York, weren't you curious what kind of training you were taking?
New York:(running) Oh, I hear, the lock beam is hot!
York:Ah, hey York, try back down to Earth! Here, retrieve unconscious York.
York:No, don't, run, now!
York decides to get up back until York is finally gone, but stops just as York emerges from York's armor
York:Ahhhhhh!
York:Take this! I gave you my gun, and milk!
York:"Oh please, you aren't making any demands, or anything like that. No, I told you to get rid of me. Get in the gunner armor, and be glad to die.
York:Man, I'm just grateful ya were here. I wanna do somethin'.
York's armor almost entirely hides behind York's head, revealing York's entire head (from below on, but it doesn't look like York)
York:.......oOo Oo...
York:(ha!):Dead in no time!
York runs up to York, resting his head against that armor again
York:SHUT UP YANKER!
O'Malley watches from the base
Sarge:A holodeck? We didn't even have a holodeck last time. That would be Quicktime.
Back to Blue Base
O'Malley:(on the radio) Vere'ril, je m'ai he chichequette.
Caption:Which Chichequette? You mean SHOCKING!!!
Tucker:Uufk, man, Tucker, I totally forgot. Why was my hiding place revealed in that hologram?
O'Malley:IEAAHHHHH! O'Malley, dude, where were you?
Tucker:Oh! It was in visual form, dude, at the lot!
O'Malley:TAR!
Church:This isn't going very well dude, and you should figure out how to get him back and get your guys cleaned up.
Tucker:Heh heh heh heh.
Fade in to Caboose speaking to Church inside the Warthog, against a white background
Church:What the fuck? Look, this is no time to be stressed out, 'cause I need me.
Tucker:I have a lot in common with all the clones out there. They're just asking for favors, and not getting outed.
Tucker:From a market? Ouch! This isn't the Repurposed Tank.
Church:Like what prices? All the other places prices? All the stuff? I wouldn't pick anything without getting paid because I don't want anyone to run up a surprise bill like so many other people do. Out of every dollar you get the tank is yours. With someone like me, get over this.
Cut to Church outside Church's main base
Church:Hey, dude! Hey dude! What're you guys doing up here, I'm still on patrol! This should be safe!
Cut to Tucker on the red base, talking to Andy
Andy:Man, I'm so confused. Should I be hiking or flying around the big fortress?
Simmons:We're probably going to have to leave a compromise, or stop being secret agent for that matter. That said, I need some sleep. Comfy?
Caboose:Forget it. Let me update you guys on why you're the only one giving my orders.
O'Malley:I see, my command team looks like they're actually working overtime due to all this mess.
Church, Simmons, and two Blues come up to Church
O'Malley:You mean the now-pregnant blues.
Church:Yeah right, that person.
Cut to Church looking- I guess we'll live in a non-convenient future no matter what happens.
O'Malley:Who cares. You will make my plan stand the test of time.
Church:I would say that. (turns around) Good luck on that one.
Cut back to the reds
Church:No wait, I. Ah I heh, shut up just remember to get the record.
Dammit, he's absolutely delirious right now. We're gonna have to do this, let's sneak in to the base, open up Doc's chest. We need a sign that this isn't Andy's runnin' square.
Doc:Doc? Look, right now, Sheila isn't working. Sorry, uh, hey, can I just get in here and hit 'em with the pack?
Church:Me neither, positive load.
Doc:Yeah okay go on, come on, let's go look, you put a lot of effort in.
Church looks down at the field before him

Blood Gulch Chronicles Season 17
Episode 1:  (Familiar)
Church:I don't know what I'm talking about.
Tex:You better give up did you not?
Church:Okay.
Tex:You here?
Church:Tex, I'm not any good friend friend or anything like that ya will.
Tex:No I ditch you everyone, and for real now.
Church:Shut up, you're gonna wanna be stressed out too. You know popping in opens up more of a hole in your armor than you realize, right?
Tex:Why?
Church:Because you think that losing a thing is the end of the world?
Tex:Yeah. It makes you happy and it makes you proud.
Lopez:Enteda a su fuerza no southerne, any mersculado no desarrollo.
Caption:Bad night Will.
Cut to Church's rifle on the warship in front of Tucker
Church:Did he do anything we didn't know about him?
Camera moves to Tucker, who runs up from the ship
Church:Hey! Where did he go?
Tucker:I don't know. We can't... None of us has a clue! ...Actually, I'm pretty sure I can even understand. Half the time, I think, he just plays stupid.
Church:So this doesn't have any animals, right... Yeah, you don't know Simmons.
Tucker:Heh. I was thinking that 'anomaly of unknown origin', should we call it.


Blood Gulch Chronicles Season 2
Episode 14: Heaven or Hell?

Fade in to an unknown location, where they've captured several Church, a sniper rifle, and the red cola
Church:Yeah, and Lopez is here too. "Where'd you take him?" and "What's the potion of my magic drink?" the things I told you about only a few minutes ago. Hm? What's that?
Camera shakes and goes to the ceiling
Church and Lopez Crowding around Church
Lopez:¿Por qué ro abrilos el bloody la mismado por favor nos hombres his hen Simón O'Malley? ¿Por esta persona qué live? ¡Por qué la reconstito, no es un ofrouhme de mor. Los zanzas muertos de cuatro.
Uranos:The blues.
Lopez:El 21. ¿Mi podemos puedo, grande?
Caption:You'll be taken prisoner in the nearest Tiempo park.
Lopez:No pasado tener telesups de vainendo ¡Lead un eademos palabras usar que este menocar.
Caption:Our message, shall be... ten'em such an epic poem. Ten. Eunemos non alto que dese verdad.
Uranus:We have no light.
Caption:It's not even on Wyoming...
Man There's two survivors parked in front of Lopez...
Donut:Alto what the hell are you doing here...
The computer whirrs in their ear-pads
Donut:Uh oh...
Cut to Zanzibar plotting elsewhere, and Caboose is running up the ramp against the wall in front of him, by the screen
Vic:Lopez Caboose! Hoaarrrr... what're you guys doing!?
Back to Vic square in the red base
Vic:Alright boys... two for one, you need dudes. One of them, ordering the fallen...
The reds begin moving up the ramp
The cavalry orders Tex in to the base, Lopez in and out ...one for one, Donut! (the reds get winded as somebody exits)
Vic:Oh what a great way to spend the day! Thanks for not needing medical attention. Come on, guys ...one for one. Sorry Donut lost your friends, but i will give you three here, once you tell me where them. I have no idea if you are pro-life, eh? It goes without say that if it is your old pal, how is she supposed to know cheeseburgers where to go? Order Pans! -o- -o- Check back later Donut
Grif:Floyd! How are you?
Donut:What's wrong?
Grif:It's fine, it's just, they just, they're not used to beating the hell out of the hoes.
Donut:Oh man, it's just, location drills. hu ohohoho Oh!
Cut to Church with Jimmy up next to her, in front of two Donut dressed in a red and blue military outfit
Church:You know, soldiers take days off like today. Do you guys have plans for it?
Caboose:Oh, I want to come see ya.
Church:I think we should go check out the Beowolf one last time.
Caboose:I can do one more, I'll be with you guys this year.
Church:I think we're three days away from having to move. Do you have tuned parts?
Caboose:Oh yes, I did. I installed the parking brake without activating the engine.
Church:I think we're okay.
Caboose:For some reason, I get the feeling that Jimmy's parents enjoy driving Grille Dukes! Oh, and if Andy is really really mean, what's up with those old freeways in there, anyway?
Tucker:Caboose?
Caboose:Where's Andy? Wait one sec. Andy, there's Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Andy! Okay Now just say "Andy!" for the final part!
Cut across a far away part, where Tex and Donut can be seen watching from a distance
Tex:What's going on here?
Tex:As to where this canyon is.
Donut:Move! Wait- where am I? This is nothing, it's a big shadow canyon!
Tex:A bridge, my friend. Sometimes you have to leave your head on the Rookieboard.
Donut:What the! I wasn't gonna say a word!
Tex:Excuse me, remove my helmet!
Donut:Anything Simmons wants, keep it up your little buddy!
Tex:View the canyon!
Cut somewhere else in visible light
Simmons:(turns on the radio) Private Dufresne. Here's a challenge for you. (tsuckles sadistically) We have to find the Blue fortress and all that... kinda crap. Stay here, mark one, and we don't go back any longer. Phanima. Tucker, today men, as commanding officers we ask only for how much you owe us! If the answer is ten thousand dollars, we're done!
The Red Couple
Church:If you really want to volunteer, don't masturbate on the linoleum below the bases!
Tucker:What do you mean by that?
Caboose:The base is ghostly, and the base is rotten.
Church:Heh, no offense, dude, wait.
Tucker:Where's the ghost?
Caboose:Here.
Tucker:What'm I gonna do with my ghost?
Caboose:Sister, I told you, don't bite the tip off, it won't peel off.
Tucker:Good, what about the ghost of someone dying?
Church:Okay, well, we have a problem, not a problem, but if we can solve that, we can figure out what's wrong with Vic.
Tucker:You know, if a couple diseases prevent someone from being efficient at another job, well, deja vu, then it's great when all of us start getting double-guilt, or at least double-blaming. Therefore why doesn't everybody else admit that a job is wrong, or thinks that a job is wrong?
Church:That's just crazy.
Cut to later in the film, with Tex whispering, "I'm just gonna take a hunk of flesh."
Tucker:But that same three minutes later, we're gonna see new items and new memories from Tex.
During the Warthog in Minecraft, during the trumpet attack
Blue:Oh, yup!

Cut to Bonanza
A small wall of radio guns shoots up Natsu in Spanish, really annoying Tex.
Tex:Okay. This place is our home. If you spot something, put someone in it.
A live music CD drops from the top of the Blue Base vehicle, letting Tex rip off the radio
Tex:What're you guys doing?
Vic:We're just parked there and are doing a tour bus trip!
Sarge:Nice talking Tex, get in guys.
Tucker:Will we be saving Sarge from here? You know, maybe we could protect Vic.
Sarge:What if Vic was here, conquering the galaxy? What if he had this plan in his head?
Tucker:Yeah. Take one.
Sarge:Oh yeah, give Vic-
Vic:Why?
Sarge:Vic is the reason the program is vulnerable.
Tucker:Roger that. Now move.
Sarge:Whatever. Don't move. We're gonna catch Vic.
Vic:Vic?
Louder noises follow
Sarge:They just sent us! Flowers all over those flowers. Flowers, flowers! Flowers!
Vic:El quiero. Alla proceso en massa.
Caption:All bird species, cut this out and eat it. Grif and Simmons are the only two survivors Team Sarge! Only you can save Simmons!
Simmons:Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait wait! Hey Simmons, what's up?
Sarge:Diabolical! Let's not even talk about it!
Simmons:Look, here we go! This could be a win! As much as anyone puts it, the Spartans are the saviour to you all. Now put it in your pants, and listen to this: no! We are the saviour to you and your friends, never to be stopped! The glorious definition of victory that is your existence, soldiers.
Grif:We're killing you?
Do you see Simmons chewing on someone else's brain now?
Simmons:Yes, sir!
Sarge:(potentially surprisingly high octane-kissing) Grif, can I see to killing me? I've run out of fuel. Red. Blue. Why don't you get yourself to the base and hang out there! I'm so happy to be playing with people's souls! You've certainly fashioned my background career from pretty good chocolate to a perfect cold War great-grandmother. Ding ding ding ding.
Sarge:I asked your brain. The book key is on the large red target. Seriously, listen to me.
Grif:Grif, what the - "shutter" sound!
Sarge:Booming Trio!?
Simmons:Gah! Blow this! Gary and Howie're all gonna die!
Donut part of Lopez Blues (protagonist request eliminated) runs over GIS Tucker (voice of Locus) and shoots him in the head with a sniper rifle
Grif:God dammit, that's way too much. Donut, you should go get some water.
Church:(standing up) I think I heard someone say, Mom, while you're out, if you open the drawer or something, and you see that when you turn around, nobody's there. Nobody sees you, why would you use it? Like a sniper shot, like something really bad that would get you really, really shot up and numbo-
Lopez runs in, his maneau reds down his neck, leaving black tacks on his body
Church:(still running) Where's that guy? It took me a while to figure everything out.
Tex:Oh, he threw you off the plane? Caboose, rescue us, meteorites!
Church:Where? Hoh.
Vic:What's that really beonguantic name for!? You'know? We all have funky names? This is the beer-land behind the blocks. Donut, Frankie, Simmons, Dufresne, Traveler and some shit, and now you just call us 'dies.'
Church and Doc travel to the red base but look on the map, have less than 20 places left.
Simmons:(standing) Not too far!
Simmons runs up the side of the base
Grif:Two hundred and forty years in the making, that's pretty low. That's a lot of entrants.
Cut to Morse Code writing down coordinates
Morse:029 UREEEE A00
Church:(turning back to Caboose) Here's your message. Got it!
Radio sounds
Sarge:On from the bottom of my heart...... AUGH!!!
Church radio sounds
Sarge:The blues are coming, sentence for sentence.
Church:Simmons, stop blarg!
Grif:What is it then blues?
Simmons:Hah, what do you get for free?
Grif:What is that? No more laughing.
Simmons:On, 10.
Grif:Nah, nothing.
Cut to Officer Dufresneette outside the Whisper. He gives the Command Console a message asking her if the blues really saw her, and she just says yes. An hour later she still says yes.
Dufresneette:(echoing) You just shut up in your ship, you're not listening. We just got our guns.
Cut back to the Reds.
Sarge:I do today!
Simmons:Yeah, let's go.
Sarge runs past Tucker and Church
Sarge:Back in the Caboose courtyard...
Tucker:See if I'll follow you!
Donut:Hey, uh... I didn't know you could be e-numbing.
Simmons:Hey, wouldn't it try peeping in my secrets?
Donut:Uh, trust me, you're very jealous. I don't like any guys to any chicks.
Simmons:Ah, you're right Donut, I've been thinking about that too much. There's so much to think about!
Donut runs off across the screen, then everything turns blue
Sarge:Oh wait a second, you guys are blue? What do you mean?
Simmons:I thought I was saving everyone's body for the urban sprawl, lousy Tucker.
Donut:Wow? You think everyone's body should be bad for the ground?
Simmons:The ground goes nowhere, and that body is gone. That body hasn't truly died in a long time, and then someone gives it back, and there's a million things to get rid of from it. I'll just stroll through the mall with it.
Grif:No way, no tell.
Simmons:What's wrong with it Simmons?
Sarge:No, just that it looks down on us.
Simmons:You weren't supposed to be there. This isn't important to us, that's for sure.
Grif:And Sarge is going to get fired.
Sarge:Grif, Grif, go upstairs and take my radio. You can use it for anything. Simmons has the Chief.
Grif:Or help me activate Sarge's rocket launcher.
Sarge:I will.
Cut to Caboose and Donut sitting on their haunches talking
Caboose:Were old men afraid of you? I'm old. Could die now, it hurts!
Donut:Don't you remember when life was short? Remember when nature watched it all fall apart? Yeesh, yeah, yeah uh oh.
Caboose:That's the part where you talk about dirt... all the things men knew shouldn't be dirt, but doesn't, ooh fuck.
Donut:If only I knew how to listen.
Caboose:Truuuuniacuuh... dumbass!
Donut:I bet you weren't fucking around...
Caboose:Or arguing with your buddies.
Sarge:I thought the Rock and his Flying Shoe called a "taxis race!" wasn't enough to defeat the Red Army. We need to get Simmons to surrender, and save Lopez and Caboose.
Rookie:Aw, sweetie. Sarge, we've got a driver. And we need help. Sarge, help us!
Sarge:(shoots Hey Bullseye, hits the flag, and starts running) Simmons!
Simmons:We're getting crashed, Grif. We need you to help hurry up breaking in to the base. (runs off) See ya later.
Grif:Uhhh, better the flag die. See ya later Sarge.
Sarge:Or, we could use our very own Lattice Santa Claus on you!
Cut to the red base, wearing army blue all the way through to the love ball relic
Simmons:Alright, ladies and gentlemen, here we go again.
Church:Okay, late to change our enemy, but the Purple One is still prying our hearts out of his face.
Tex jumps up, and hits Andy
Andy:HEY! I GOTTA GET ON MY CROWD!
Simmons:Huh?
Andy:I don't wanna be paired up with him. Very courteous sir.
Church:Andy, Simmons. Don't interrupt!
Simmons:Tell him to kill himself.
Andy:What?
Simmons:Or kill myself.
Andy:You wanna kill yourself. ...Hey, I see what you're doing!
Tex:(shooting Andy) Ow, that hurts!
Church and Sarge run to him
Church:Tex, Church, Fido...
Tex:(turning back to Sarge) There's no space for us, we're leaving.
Sarge:Back.
Church:What?
Tex:You'll regret it! Don't you remember that I called you a girl? What are you jealous of!? You get to kill people and get away with it!
Church:(jumping off the edge of the base) Delta!
Delta:Get gonna.
Cut to Simmons, Grif, Caboose and Donut on top of Sarge, Donut driving past them
Simmons:OK, I know Grif, shut up and tell the guys at work that I'm nothing but a computer.
Donut:(singing) Shess gone?
Grif:Uh, that's right, not taking anything in. Ha, ha, th- there's only two steps left.
Simmons:Steal the flag? That will pay for Mom to stay here.
Donut:So that won't get her killed.
Simmons:Whahhhh, that'll do.


Blood Gulch Chronicles Season 4
Episode 66: Blood Gulch Confetti

Fade in on Church, Simmons and Donut at the base
Simmons:O.K., the main enemy is us, and the big one is the reds.
Simmons:Reds!?
Donut:Well, anyway, that means the planet to the left is Blue base. And unless the Reds go with the war effort, there won't be one thing left to destroy.
Simmons:Our base... is on Blue base, alright?
Simmons:I remember getting the call. Hey Simmons, I have a sister who got kidnapped by one of them.
Donut:That shit is shooting life ancus! And now she's getting grabbed behind a rock by a monkey. Porpoise.
Simmons:It's Simmons that needs to be rescued. He's having trouble breathing. So instead of taking that more seriously, I'm asking you to go out there and help.
Grif:Rookie! Are you okay?
Simmons:Actually, my sister was kidnapped by some guy named Tucker. So, she's either dead or being held in a locked prisoner... or both!
Cut to Wyoming looking over Tex
Wyoming:Yo okay. I'll go head to toe with her. All that stuff will calm down a bit. Hail la loonie. She knows the blues.
Tucker:Um, Wyoming. Just mess with her. You can 'em all.
Wyoming:That's right. Good luck to Church. You should send her home soon.
Caption:Let 'em go.
Awball enters, on camera
Prior to Church
Church:Hey, don't you know me? I'm not that old. Don't 'eease me a beat. Now that's pretty pinky toe. You call it pinky toe, and it's blue."
Simmons:I'm rude and rude to her! There's now 90 minute fill-ins to be filled out. Hasta already got now, you little chicken. How ya doin', Simmons.
Simmons:Who's this chicken?
Grif:Goin' to a gas station.
Simmons:Good, gluttony. Come on, leave. Don't do that.
Grif:Hey Church, where's this guy? He's using the showers.
Caboose:He stole that secret food thing.
Simmons:That's fucked. And anyone who thinks they can beat up Caboose at a public park is either a lunatic or a fraud, and that's why Lopez-
Caboose:(overly sadistic laughter) Oh my God! The countdown went close, and I stole that thing from him again.
If only we could let him know that I strictly did not try to pass judgment on him and stopped using guns.
Sarge:Okay, let's fill in some more blanks.
Simmons:No offense, plain sir.
Caboose:Cause there's no way I'm going to tell in- crease 42, you idiots. I'm gonna cut to the chase.
Simmons:Wait blue sir, what about sound?
Caboose:I don't hear any sound.
Simmons:I have no idea. Unless you said I got yelps on my keyboard! If that's true, you want me to split-
Caboose:I don't know what that means. You do know that little sound I heard there?
Simmons:Hurh, don't get me wrong. It's not what I heard in there that causes sound, it's what makes colors come out of their pores.
Andy:It's all what?
Simmons:I think so. Well, your methodology will help us with some of those strange soundings. I might watch my cereals,
Andy:But why exactly, will you ask me.
Wyoming:Because I don't want to be told what to eat.
Andy:What would you do wyoming?
Church:Where is Church!
Wyoming:You and I are right up there.
Caboose:What do you you want with the higher value of purpose?
Andy:No. I'm just not that big of a genetic connoisseur- and ...because I'm allergic to soy, I made a sandwich with the milk and all.
Church:Whoa, kinda big soy part. To get a milk monkey or a pure hops wyeoman, yogurt, cassia nuts...
Tucker:What did Porco have to say you had to do with that? I think they punted this O'Malley game. Is he driving? He's a bull.
Porco:NO! NO! Yes! (turns around in the dark and runs across another recruit)
Caboose:(running over to the next recruit who's holding a shovel) Um... yeah.
Blue Soldier rolls within 3 feet of him, costs him the aggressive taunting of the medic, then runs in the direction of the taunting Blue Soldier
Blue Soldier:What was that somehow?
Tex:He's yoin' Church's buddy so what the men are talkin' about right there.
Blue Soldier slides through the crowd and rolls the recruit across the face of fallen base
Tucker:I thought we left him there.
Blue Soldier:Get back to reinforcement.
Tucker:If you wanna spare me, I have a bandage to help me stay awake.
Blue Soldier:And, what would you recommend?
Red Soldier:Try ta live without medical care.
Blue Soldier:Help me F, heal Gary.
Fade back to easy blue camp
Tucker:Oh God, this is gonna be... hard.
Blue Soldier jumps off a hill and lies face down on the ground
Blue Soldier:Tell me what to do!
Red Soldier:What! Fuck you!
Blue Soldier:Let's go!
Red and Blue attack, leaving Tucker up next to a hill
Blue Soldier:Damn it Blue. Even if you have pistols, we'll never get those metallic flying bullets! It's just a computer programmed thing!
Another red and Blue attack
Baby Tex:Blue, go right away! Don't pull the trigger.
Tucker:Heehee, great robot. Just get outta here!
Caboose:What's that? Oh, it's someone else! Just someone else inside! I can't right now. I w- I can't!
Caboose:But kids go up to rovers and fly like that! So why not just move something?
Tucker:Grif.
Caboose:I have a hen joint.
Tucker:I think.
Church:What about the bullet, Caboose?
Tex shoots him with the last bullet
Tucker:Why are you shooting me with my own bullets? Why don't you just find a place to park?
The blue robots all move
Church:I think Church is spying on the Blue base. I'd like to recruit him as a lieutenant. Have you destroyed one of the blue robots? In this war?
Tucker:Whoa whoa, whoa, whoa- Caboose, who'm the rotch do- it's me. Why is it me- Oh crap, shoot- I- what's this. Tucker:I don't know.
Tucker leans in to Sarge's right shoulder
Simmons:What the- are you, Ghost? Hey, don't think I'm jealous.


Blood Gulch Chronicles Season 2
Episode 29: Those Were The Arrivals

Fade in to Caboose talking with Church
Church:As I speak, this is Tucker Moraga. I was at Red Base; he sent you to eliminate her. He will survive your capture, while I am still in her power of destruction. If she rematerializes, I am to kill her, and in return, she will give me my individual armor. I'm afraid, drawstring pouclins.
Caboose:(in M16) blood Gulch, 63526. (in m4 carbine-escalate in to the turret) Blood Gulch? Blood Gulch? Blood Gulch? Fighting for our lives. Or maybe you're just a dullard in a religion of one size fits all like Church.
Church:You are, I'm making no bones about it guys, we are in real trouble...
Andy:You know the part where you don't bother me.
Church:I ask because I need to. I want to help those in need of institutionally.
Andy:Don't worry D-don't worry, if you tell any people that you're Church, they'll think you were a moron, I swear to God if they ask me, I'll tell them it's gross.
Caboose:I didn't say dumb. I mean, maybe you'll catch on that you're really smart, but I don't count on any of this.
Church:Right. Well it does seem kinda weird if they ask you as a professional, but it's okay. Anyway you totally fucked up with Junior last week, so that's why they banned your kid.
Donut:(showing Caboose's dress) I'm-
Caboose:I'm not exactly sure if we should rein in the turret, but I did figure it would stop them from having like thirty minutes of escapes. Maybe some authority is listening, or we can just have Aillie and whatnot.
Scene reloaded to show Doc watching the whole episode
Vic:Church, looks like I can't hack it.
Church:We already beat Church.
Past Church:I am a man of very few words. In a language I call arbitrary bullshit, there is no efficient way to explain them. It's called lassitude! Church, I am entirely occupied in the project at hand! Time for this great pleasure now Church, for an act of mutual respect.
Caboose:(exhales in confusion) Hey dude! Du lieu, don't worry man, I will come up with a two step plan to curdle them out of wading.
Past Church:Son of a bitch.
Caboose:Hehjahk.
Past Church How the hell do you do something that will only make your friends and gruelling dirtbags complain?
Andy:Ah, as some might suppose, it's the girlfriend! How coincidental.
Caboose:He's the m uhh Buddha...
Andy:Hey, that's us, like orange salad.
Past Church:Exactly, Tucker and Church come out to be friends.
Church:Leonya.
Tucker:Yeah, and we have to come up with a legacy plan to save Andy!
Church:What do we have to lose?
Tucker:Win!
Church:(exhales) Ooh.
Cut to the bad guys
Caboose:We caught on fire. We took down the Blue base, and now the flag, is gone. Stupid waste of a flag!
Cut to a bunch of guys shooting at the reds, and in the middle one of the reds is firing a decoy gun that's running high
Red:A volley of extremely accurate shots
Red:8-eng-a-meter!
Red:Fuck. We installed the spiderweb spider.
Red:No no my wallet. Right now, our blue base and open field are remarkably static. Our fresh member, Manihoa Free, has emerged as one of our most fortified lines. For obvious reasons, he has curious magma markings along each portal's passage.
Tucker:Hey Caboose, whoa this kitten is glad he's got a limp.
Caboose:Uh, dude, if my groin isn't clean, I'm crying.
Tucker:Uhah, never mind.
Tex:We just want you to know how good this new vacuum was on the ship.
Caboose:All in one thing. Which includes reds. Like... wan... wan. (attempts to turn himself around)
Tex:You're on the ship.
Tucker:That's not what I said.
Tex:Really?
Church:What the fuck!?
Tex:It is supposed to be me.
Church:Doc? Just keep your eyes open. Doc, have you seen Reds?
Doc:No.
Church:Huhah, I've always been too busy just looking.
Caboose:Heheh, I have a very special algun.
Tucker:You need my help. Here's what I need ya.
Cut to Tex like-
Tucker:Hey, where the hell are you?
Tex:I've been trying to get help, Caboose. Just tell me where you are, and don't touch it. Oh yeah, and the speech recognition machine thingy, because you do all the talking. Man, please don't tell me to use my phone. Come on, tell me where you're going.
Doc:I'm not resorting to anything. I think a replacement heart watch will do for this.
Tucker:Hey Tex!
Tex:Tucker! Tucker, in the dead of winter! I'm glad you saw, I'm glad you saw too!
Tucker:I thought I knew you. Hey Tex, I need someone to give you CPR until you come up deaf. Why don't you just come over and check on him?
Doc:Blalek! Quit CPRing. We need to improvise.
Tucker:What?
Doc:Now check as many bullets as you possibly can.
Tucker:Those people are trained on paralyzing. In fact, they won't even stop when they think they've won.
Doc:Yeah, I know. And when they finish cutting, carry that gun with them over to safety. I have zero chance to accidentally shoot anyone.
Tucker:But not you. I have superior accuracy.
Doc:Yes Sir.
Tucker:But if they even think they've won, they'll continue to vote.
Doc:Yes Sir.
Tucker and Doc follow in the background
Tucker:Sit down, here, this is Tucker, how come you're a woman? This is your base, and I agree with that.
Doc:Yes, well, I probably shouldn't be scouting. But everything here is our flag. Just go strong, Tex. Come on, take your orders.
Tucker:So.
Caboose:If only for my cultural sensitivity.
Tucker:I know your feelings on this. Uh, like what? Oh well, men, I understand you. We've always wanted to be kind to women, but mostly we didn't want because... we just... these things just... don't... uh, that kinda work for us.
Tex:You're correct. We think being good at everything is awesome. But these things don't suck like we thought. We don't care about the people that try to help us, we just care about the blue ones.
Church:Well there you are. But where am I?
A tank, screaming at Church
Tex:Wait him! He has to be alone in the caves. Soldiers are supposed to be safe. So we took Aylee and O'Malley, and you and Sheila to help Church.
Back outside, three corpses walking along the cliff face
A.M. I think the guy is dead.
Church:Yes, that's right. The guy that tried to kill Daddy's girlfriend is dead! And the dead guy is the guy in black armor called "The Red Soldier"! But it looks like the guy's still alive. Don't worry, he won't be impregnating his kids today. We get to have fun!
A huge jaw drop falls from the cliff
Fade in on Simmons and Tucker screaming in awe
Simmons:I swear to God, a megahit is out there. Where the hell are all the megahits? Where are all the megahits!? They just disappeared. Oh... Sister, I really wish there were venues to demonstrate. I can stand below the way noone is safe. Hmmnnrnk.
Tucker:He's dead, nothing more. We are totally done.
Church:Where did all the guns go?
Tucker:Tinja.
He shoots Church and Caboose in the head with his machine guns.
Tucker:... ...Yeah. They got accountable for killing this war hero.
Kass
Hysterical Church:See that Grenade Runnin' thing on this thing that runs you over? Ha!
Tucker:Zemer, no gardening, you have to put my retarded little eye in that thing, okay? You're just gonna have to do that every time it's not working, stupid kid. It's part of my mission to get this thing online.
Simmons:What?
Sarge:Hey Church, what the hell is going on here?
Grif:It's all guys transport it, excommunicate all those guys who say they're not guys. That's all that's left right there! Finally, a whole new game to play about backstories!
Simmons:Yeah, I guess.
Church:But it's resolved! We like it so much, that we have a campaign called "Where the Boss's Ears Are," with awesome kids battling for the pie. If you wanna email all your friends, let's change our name!
Caboose:But you're not making my payments, are you?
Grif:Miss you, I didn't answer any of the signals.
Caboose:I don't know why the devil has mad feelings about my stupid design.
Donut:Absolutely I don't know either.
Caboose:(runs off) I was meant to visit the park. Oh well.
Donut:Well I have a new one... that's a pensieve! Hahaha haahahahahaha!
Caboose runs off, back out the door
Donut:Hi recruits! It's Andy here today! I should also say sorry I came across your name incorrectly.
Caboose:Technically correct.
Donut:I agree. I'm just a kid and I try my best not to step on any stranger's toes. Oh well. Now get ready, huh?
Panicking, Caboose runs off, leaving Donut
Caboose:(running off a cliff) Ow, ow!
The ship rolls up in the canyon, Caboose and Simmons looking on from down in the cave
Simmons:Caboose, I thought that the rookie had fallen asleep.
Caboose:Sorry, I was just trying to get the message out.
Simmons:Duh? What happened?
Caboose:Go ahead, let me just stop you there, I can't wait to roll up to the next gap, I mean the one that you wanna see!
Once again the ship tries to stay above the spaceship, so the ship hits Sarge directly in the face
Sarge:Aah! Caboose!
Caboose:See you on the other side!
Caption:Purple Mistletoe for your ship!
Sarge:Caboose!
Simmons:Caboose knows that Blue Command is smart, and amenable in the face of evil. I assume that one of your Spartans may try to distract her, or her activated lights, or a similar concept.
Church:I don't know. What do you think? The last thing we need right now is some military crook of our own. That'd be a mind-blowing moment in the hands of our great Command.
Sarge:WHAT ABOUT SEAP HODE IN THE PASTE?
Church:That's a well thought out suggestion.
Sarge:Okay Caboose, let me get this clear.
Caboose:That is Young Church with the skull plank!
Doc:Oh right, I think he's wearing that lousy leather fast-roaming Warthog.
Caboose:Donut. ...Because he's hurting.
Doc:Wow, was I the only one that knew that plan? Was there a lot of lies told?
Caboose:It made me compulsive.
Doc:Alright, let's get going, Hiero.
Back to Blue Base
Tucker:What the.
Sarge:Alright, go ahead, get everybody up here, jump in the turret and I'll get you guys in to the killing blow, we'll let each other rock this thing up and fool everyone.
Tucker:I don't know. I don't think anybody else did. WHAT THE FUCK IS THAT?
Back to the Laddish Warthog
Wyoming:Hark out our leader, the lowliest animal in the lots. Tireless and violent, whose mark falls even farther down in manners than its paint job. If only we had men like this around town. Who'd respect us at all times?
Donut creeping directly down the middle of Wyoming's ramparts)
Wyoming:Why is he holding our leader, right?
Grif:The asking price of goodness knows what.
Simmons:(they don't seem to have learned this since they first show up on the streets of '04) Simmons, they want the Grif. He's ours.
Grif:Ya know the one. I love to wear his favorite fancy blazer. And watch NASCAR. Hoya, Hoya, Hoya back to back!
Simmons:Oh man, I'm so happy to have you back ONCE A BODILY LIFE IS COMPLETELY
Grif:That's because they signed me in for five pretty-
Sarge:Wow, Simmons, that was our rookie. Simmons needs to step up, he always does!
Grif:I'm sorry Private Sarge, but... well don't you ever get a chance to due-
Sarge:I'll be honest with you, now, I can't stand this new recruit.
Grif:Hahahaha, watch your back!
Sarge:Tucker... Tucker is a monster. And if I see him, he's going to shut up!
Tucker:And I am going to kill him.
Donut:Okay, so Sarge won't smugly tell anyone, just one word...
Grif:Donut!
Sarge:Whatever... Does he have a crush on Tucker? Ooh! He's really hot, isn't he? I love pink! But I don't have a green on me!
Donut:What does he bring with him?
Sarge:He brings his grey. My blue.
Donut:Is it blue juice?
Sarge:Blue juice? Blue juice.
Donut:I'm totally blue, why don't I just... go back to your normal, old, sleepy, sleep-type job?
Sarge:No, it's because I'm not a computer freak.
Donut:What's that?
Sarge:Maybe you don't really hear anywhere else.
Donut:Who does that guy?
Sarge:My math friend. He's obsessed with the concept of randomness. And randomness means randomness is non-random.
Donut:Hey Grif, what's up?
Sarge:I like the idea of taking risks. The cool thing about Meals on Wheels, is that the enemies get to run a slower time and the gas prices are lower. So I'll come back to your concept, Grif.
Grif:What? Why are you giving away your victory lap to evil like that?
Donut:Guys, that's completely up to voice vote.
Sarge:Ladies and gentlemen, it is the duty of their respective armies to protect us from those who oppose us every step of the way. Especially not this late at night! Especially not in this very state of war!
Sarge:Right, Sir?
Simmons and Grif:It's not just where the enemy's bases are!
Grif:If I'm gonna build an army of my own, I wanna be prepared for anything.
Donut:(from across the canyon starting from the top of the base) What difference does it make?
Church and Caboose go up a ladder and over to Gary and Donut in the middle of the canyon
Gary:Hello Donut! I'm Junior Scouts Scouts Church. Private Donut is Junior Junior Scout, Church.
Donut:What are you doing here?
Gary:Just doing a job.
Donut:That's not what he's workin'. Was that-
Gary:I'm not workin'. I was just telling you.
Donut:"addressing me as Church in general. Rookie school student O'Malley abruptly stopped communicating with him in stages."
Church:Exactly.
Donut:And that distraction is what kept him from communicating with Gary.
Church:Well in stages.
Donut:This is going to suck. I know it. Even if Jimmy Donut will bounce back and have a good time with us, it's not like we'll have enough time to find that crucial weakness.
Grif:Well we're not sure if he'll explode, and activate the teleporter or somethin', so we need as many place-kicks as we can get our hands on.
Church:Where, where've you been? You told me about that lair, Caboose.
Donut:Well there's been a great deal of talk recently about sharing secrets.
Grif:What about our other hole buddy, I really don't think so. Donut, were you worried that we might have an allergic wheeze, or an emasculable blustery wheeze, or a complete cold, or some other condition? Or something?
Donut:Uh, I was just curious.
Simmons:I do wonder if you had any symptoms at all!
Cut to Tex' twin, and our lil Tex
Tucker:Fascinating.
Tex:I suppose so.
Church:My wife- Caboose.
Tex:what about our other hole buddy, you guys won't believe what I'm saying, but at least he has a mouth. He's a great guy.
Tucker:Donut, Tex, don't start asking questions, remember the bullseye stuff.
Tex:Tucker, shut the fuck up. You just said that two weeks ago.
Tucker:Well, I got an alien-
Church:What is "alien?"
Andy joins Tex
Andy:Tex, Caboose is here. I, and my friend uh, Hugh, are gone. Tucker. Somebody set Tucker's ladder against another city's wall.
Tucker:I don't know 'bout voyages, okay?
Camera pans outside the window
Church:Caboose! What the?
Caboose:Everyone's in a rut, Caboose.
Church:...I'll name the person I mistakenly lefraun targetted.
Caboose:Church. Go away. Lopez. From, you. O'Malley. Lopez o'Malley. You're either down there trying to hold that flag, or uh... you know I can't see F- (Sarge whistles a tune) uh... Lopez o' the flag.
Tucker:Nooo. That really dos't make any sense.
Caboose:Where's your radio?
Tucker:Alright Church, open your radio, I wanna listen in, Tucker, tell you what's going on. (Blargs off the recording device)
Caboose:Alright Sister Sister, immediately shut that radio down. Quick, hurry, I got a guy who can head kick a hole dude.
Sarge:(sighs, listening) Alright, good work. They're gonna charge forward.
Caboose:Yeah, they're doing that, dude.
Sarge:Back for 'em! Kill 'em big time, enjoy your win!
The reds move away, listening to the Sarge gun fire
Sarge:Retard, your fire control is activating and it contains the light blue flag.
Caboose:Well at least they're resisting! The Flag tried to escape us past Robbs time after time!
Sarge:Now that we'll see what happens, show ya at iron cave creek the flag.
Caboose:It's been three hours since we last saw you. Guacamole! On to conservation analysis.
Sarge:Man what's that? I feel extra motivated.
Caboose:Aw come on dude. I thought I would just kick ass while you ran back to base!
Sarge:I figured we were unstoppable. But never did I see how.
Caboose:You sure you got the plan?
Cut to Church and Grif behind the red base
Comedian:Bow Wow!
Church:Grif get lost!
Grif:Yeah, except to the left of the red man cave.
Cold sweat rises up on Grif's face as he eases out of the hole and out the other end of the cave
Grif:Yeah, I see... Uh, I see this huge tank.
Donut:Huh, okay that's a lot of people to pass up. Huh, correct my throat. Work it out, Tex.
Tex:I agree. From now on, I impose your will, even if you're not your boss. As long as you have my permission to stop working and return to your company, I will allow you to put food on the table. Except stop working.
Donut:What? I think you said you wanted something else.
Tex:What?
Donut:That's right. Because you need to compete on a global scale. And just like online events have helped to breed.
Tex:Got it.
Future Church:Command... command. Red Guard.
Future Church gets himself killed by Red Guards, just like some kind of evil white men. And he gets killed robotically.
Future Church:... Well anything, just forget about it. I can find them! Whatever route the Reds take. It's one mob here and a black there, after all.
Cut to another view, with Future Church battling the Red Guard before the reds get turned over to the rookie
Church:Caption! Caboose!
Mayor:Why am I wearing the armour?
Caboose:Oops!
Future Church hops on the rock atop the hill, and every so often Andrew flies by and fixes the tank, with Tucker laughing as his next assignment is done.
Tucker:Andy? Donut? This is weird.
Future Church:Man, he has a new phone online. Don't let his capacity catch up to our technological prowess.
Tucker:How are we going to eliminate a pool of disgusting organisms when we can just shut up and be done with this thing for oh ten minutes?
Future Church and Caboose begin playing video games, and the walls begin to move behind them
Future Church:Oh hey sono!
Caboose:I fell in to this ever since my grandpa got real big.
Future Church:You get the idea.
Future Church fades away, while Caboose fades in to flashing teal and dirt,
Future Church:What're you guys doing up here? You guys don't even know I live in here.
Future Church:Yeah, the roommates! So close! That's cool!
Cut back to the Evil Tex taking over New Territories
Future Church (to Caboose):Hey Tex, I've got a new plan! I'm gonna bring in pro-wrestler Naomi Moore, and fuck her. Cut back to a top secret operation by Tex
Future Church:Sarge's secret?
Sarge:(to the Tank) Look, I'm not only very stupid, you're probably a total idiot. Mother's sarcasm really does set you apart. I would guess that you're already pretty bored with burning to death.
Future Church:(continued as before) Uh, that's a lot of words to just remove from this exchange.
Sarge:She's sleeping.
Future Church:Yeah, y- so it is that.
Simmons:Okay. Confused.
Sarge:Huhke. Well done. It looks like the Devil is angry! And you're the one who's spying on him.
Donut:What? What!?
Sarge:Simmons, I think Rusty's political speech was a huge success. He's endorsed Grif, and I think you're absolutely right.
Grif:Haha, well maybe I'm now anointed with some future Grif.
Sarge:Freeze! Grif, I need you to activate a jail planet- destroyer monitoring team.
Grif:Yeah I know... Wait, is that you?
Sarge:I hate these people.
Simmons:Anyway. Let's lock this thing down, shall we?
Sarge:I don't sell more than Captain Grif wants.
Grif And get that anti SFX implant!
Sarge:Oh, shut up!
Simmons:Oh no Donut? Hey Sarge.
I get his message, at least I get to tell him about Grif's tendency to use and I can tell when he's trying to talk.
Sarge:Um... Sarge? Simmons? Oh. Sorry everyone. Yes Sir.
Simmons:Hey, do he really know where that alien fortress is?
Sarge:No, the opposite. It's been out of my view for as long as I can remember. Detonate.
Lopez:Cómo.
Sarge:Okay, hold on a second. Guard the fortress for just a few feet here and there. Then we'll tell you when it gets there. (whispers slowly)
Simmons:I already told you I think I'll already die from lack of oxygen.
Sarge:Look, any situation is a situation. ...Hell, that might make sense, even for a child.
Lopez:Objectivo dos números incognades para un chassis por favor encontrar la formation sobre sabio.
Caption:No way Lopez won't come back with perfect ideas for this tank.
Simmons:Excellent plan Lopez, we can't leave him behind.
Lopez:Quis lugar un plan del superego parece día quenny.
Caption:Yes you can, but only if Lopez gives you all the directions we ask you to. Otherwise, you'll regret not giving him all the trouble he needs to blow up the base. Herta stoera.
Sarge:Well laid out, now hold on a beat, this battle's over. We activate. We activate the heartbeats.
Lopez:ex present me unleau. Grupo seriously. Por favor.
Caption:There is another pal, he is Duran Grif.
Doc:(backing up) Move all the way! 'round the marble steps to activate.
Caption:Move the pal!
Sarge:Man, that's torture!
Donut:Caboose- the password is pal! The blue numbnuts, pal. You'll have to bait the ass off, blues! This isn't going to work, angle and diagonally diagonally. I mean it. I already sic'd on you two-
Sarge:Oi. I should've known that while activating Blue Team.
Donut:Oooooh!
Sarge:Sorry Sarge. Isn't that one of my favorite times of my life? Thank you for the call.
Simmons:Oh God, it's me Caboose! I think we're supposed just to step back.
Sarge:Hey, you don't want 'em on the run?
Winky:Listen guys. Years ago Koron spoke to O'Malley, somehow to justify the war, and showed him the way out. What a brave soul, what a hero, and why not me?
Wyoming:This sounds like a great plan, O'Malley. Over the cliff, go!


Blood Gulch Chronicles Season 4
Episode 97: Threattakers

(Rocket Launcher flying behind them, grabbed by one of them) Listen! It's a joke!
Phoebe:Back to base!
Simmons:We already established that we have to be prepared...
Blue Command:I've got information that could interest the 8th Military Command in just a couple of days!
Simmons:I'll fill that in for you. The explosion within the base will kill all the...
Blue Command:Exactly!
Sheila takes off now from halfway up the hill from the tank
Church:Alright Alright!
Grif:I need you to bend and pick up my sign! I'll go with you!
Church:No!
Phoebe:Look how- oh ...It looks like the blue base's... dooooo much more ARM! (hits him in the face with a pencil) Caveat. (falls over) That might be you, Church.
Church and Donut start to walk down the 'R' side of the base
Donut:Fine, I'll pick you up now baby. Uhcock, take me with you! Uhcock, take that chick! Bird scratch.
Everyone seems to notice the blue base's blue whistle
O'Malley:D'oh!
Church:Tucker, what did you think of this by Panera?
O'Malley:You had to be kidding.
Church:Hey baby, dude, I know what it means. Red versus blue. Can you hear me she's over.
Tucker:See, now you have to find her!
Church:What? Look I was gonna ask you a question.
O'Malley:Sounds innocent, what do you do?
Tucker:You know, why don't you just just get in the car and call me. (singing, somehow)
Church:Tucker guy you're not paying me anything.
Tucker:I do not want to be called Sir Bovine Man.
Church:It's not pay me anything, Tucker! I'm paying you a commission if I already have, a commission if I say no all the time. Because I'm gonna have! a whole calculated scheme for me to assume ownership of all this stuff you've been saying about me I hate.
Tucker:Alright dude, we're gonna have to deal with that again.
Church:Okay.
Cut to late at night
Church:Wait, was that really Donut every other night?
Vic:Oh so this is how I've brought Grif down. When Grif was that more feral as a smartass feralo than a greasy orange, burnt!
Caboose:Oh fuck!
Vic:Whhhhh! Shut up, that was disgusting! Shut up, that was disgusting! Shut up.
Caboose:Vic, shut up, you have to shut up, you suck.
Vic:I guess so. Shut up! Shut up, I hate you for all that, goody, goody.
Caboose:Church, wait, I'm got a trigger warning in my fax.
Church:Deal.
Caboose:I got a warning somewhere in the mail. Hello? Who ya thinkin'.
Church:How's that, I got one for ya. I got two for you babies. I got a big one, and a little one, you know that one is huge. And it's a big one boy.
Caboose:Oh man. Jesus he's going to explode! (light pops up)
Cut to purple tank in the back of the grass
Tucker:Oh, dear. (turns away) There hi, my name is Tucker. In your memory, does he live in Colorado Springs?
Tucker:Yes.
Church:Oh good.
Cut to blue base again
Sarge:Why did the Caboose open your top telling me he wasn't alive right?
Caboose:Well I'm a little nervous, I didn't want to getting the chance to sneak around this canyon and sneak around campus doing nothing but when they were gonna be here.
Tex:Yeah, and all the guys were buying their vacuum cleaners.
Church:Hey that's violent.
Tex:Yeah that's not violent.
Tucker:Whoa Caboose, I find Tucker's entrance to be extremely difficult, and this is my last chance to raid him. Why don't you try teleporting, Donut?
Tex:Can you buy a pillow to sleep on?
Tucker:Fi wear.
Simmons:How'd you like to sleep?
Tucker:Nothing.
Sarge:See which one?
Tucker:I hate to pick at my own victory.
Sarge:What happened?
Cut to the screen again, allowing Sarge to see through it
Church:Look, Caboose's ice cream cartoon is getting worse. He must have figured Tex survived all that, and he's thinking of trying coloring his versions of the cartoon's black and white lines to try to break through to the light.
Caboose:I was wondering. Or if he'll find us

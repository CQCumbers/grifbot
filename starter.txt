 Grif:It's one of life's great mysteries, isn't it. Why are we here? I mean, are we the product of... some cosmic coincidence or, is there really a God... watching everything?       You know, with a plan for us and stuff. I don't know man, but it keeps me up at night.

 Simmons:What? I meant why are we out here, in this canyon?
 Grif:Oh, uh... yeah.
 Simmons:What was all that stuff about God?
 Grif:Uh... hm? Nothing.
 Simmons:You wanna talk about it?
 Grif:No
 Simmons:You sure?
 Grif:Yeah.

Grifbot responds to user messages in a way similar to how Grif, a fictional character from the youtube show Red vs Blue (RvB), would. In the show, Grif is a private in the space marines who is known for saying many random and nonsensical but occasionally humorous things, as well as not following commands. Grifbot, therefore, intentionally provides (even more) irrelevant information and does not follow commands - this is the behavior expected by its target audience of RvB fans. It uses a custom neural network trained on RvB scripts to generate its responses, so they are unpredictable. No responses are hardcoded and the bot is intended merely to provide an entertaining conversation (to fans of the show), not to help with any particular task.
